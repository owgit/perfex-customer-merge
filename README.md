## üì• Installation

### Manual Installation

1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/owgit/customer_merge/releases)
2. **Extract** the downloaded ZIP file
3. **Upload** the `customer_merge` folder to the `modules` directory of your Perfex CRM installation
4. **Navigate** to `Setup ‚Üí Modules` in your Perfex CRM admin panel
5. **Find** the Customer Merge module and click the "Activate" button
6. **Refresh** your browser to complete the installation

### Using Composer

```bash
composer require owgit/customer_merge
```

### Using Git

```bash
cd /path/to/perfex/modules
git clone https://github.com/owgit/customer_merge.git
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Accessing the Module

1. Navigate to `Customers ‚Üí Customer Merge` in the main menu
2. Alternatively, access the merge function directly from any customer's profile page via the "Merge with another customer" button

### Merging Customers

1. **Select Source Customer**: Choose the customer that will be merged (this customer will be deleted after the merge)
2. **Select Target Customer**: Choose the customer that will receive all the data (this customer will be kept)
3. **Configure Merge Options**: Select which data elements to merge
4. **Review Customer Data**: Optionally select specific customer data fields to transfer
5. **Confirm and Execute**: Review the warning message, check the confirmation box, and click "Merge Customers"

### Viewing Merge History

1. Go to `Customers ‚Üí Customer Merge`
2. View the list of all merge operations performed

### Rolling Back a Merge

If you need to undo a merge operation:

1. Go to `Customers ‚Üí Customer Merge`
2. Find the merge operation you want to rollback
3. Click the rollback button (undo icon)
4. Confirm the rollback

The rollback process will:
- Create a new customer with the original source customer name
- Move data created after the merge back to the new customer
- Mark the merge operation as rolled back

**Note:** The rollback process is not a perfect undo. It creates a new customer (with a new ID) and only moves data created after the merge. Data that existed before the merge will remain with the target customer.

## üìä Data Handling

The following data is migrated during the merge process:

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Contacts | All contacts and their permissions |
| Invoices | All invoices and their items |
| Estimates | All estimates and their items |
| Projects | All projects and their tasks |
| Expenses | All expenses and their receipts |
| Payments | All payment records |
| Tasks | All tasks and their comments |
| Notes | All customer notes |
| Files | All uploaded files |
| Contracts | All contracts and their renewals |
| Tickets | All support tickets and their replies |
| Proposals | All proposals and their content |
| Custom Fields | All custom field values with intelligent merging |
| Customer Groups | All group memberships |

## üîÑ Custom Fields Merging

The module features an enhanced custom fields merging system that intelligently handles different field types:

### Select/Multiselect Fields (like "customers_kundtyp")
- Values are combined rather than replaced when both customers have different values
- The system creates a comma-separated list of unique values from both customers
- Special handling for "customers_kundtyp" ensures customer type information is preserved from both records

### Other Field Types
- **Checkboxes**: If source is checked but target isn't, the target will be checked
- **Dates**: The most recent date is kept
- **Text/Textarea**: Text is combined with a separator if both have content
- **Other types**: Source value is used only if target is empty

### Benefits
- No information is lost during merging
- Values are combined in a way that makes sense for each field type
- Detailed logs show exactly what happened during the merge

## üë§ Primary Contact Handling

When merging customers, the primary contact is handled as follows:

- The target customer's primary contact is always preserved as the primary contact
- Any primary contact from the source customer will be transferred but will no longer be marked as primary
- If the target customer has no primary contact, the first transferred contact may be set as primary

## üîí Permissions

The module adds two custom permissions:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| View Customer Merge | Allows staff to view the merge history |
| Create Customer Merge | Allows staff to perform customer merges and rollback merges |

By default, only administrators have full permissions. You can modify permissions in `Setup ‚Üí Staff ‚Üí Roles`.

## üåê Language Support

The module currently supports the following languages:

- English
- Swedish

### Adding a New Language

To add support for additional languages:

1. Create a new directory in `modules/customer_merge/language/` with the language name (e.g., `french`)
2. Copy the `customer_merge_lang.php` file from the `english` directory to your new language directory
3. Translate all strings in the file
4. The module will automatically detect and use the new language file
